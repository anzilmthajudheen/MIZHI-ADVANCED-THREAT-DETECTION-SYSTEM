# MIZHI: Advanced CCTV-Based Weapon & Threat Detection System

> **MIZHI** is an AI-powered, GUI-based application for real-time detection of weapons, suspicious objects, and aggressive human behavior from CCTV feeds or video files.  
> It combines **YOLOv8 object detection**, **MediaPipe pose estimation**, and **LSTM-based behavioral analysis** to provide instant alerts for enhanced security monitoring.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection** using YOLOv8
- **Weapon Classification**:
  - 🟥 **Red Box** – Real weapons (gun, knife, rifle, sword, axe, etc.)
  - 🟨 **Yellow Box** – Potential fake weapon sources (mobile, laptop, TV, etc.)
  - 🟧 **Orange Box** – Suspicious objects (stick, tool, wrench, screwdriver)
- **Pose Detection & Aggression Analysis** using MediaPipe
- **Behavioral Analysis** using ResNet50 feature extractor + LSTM
- **Automated Alerts** overlay on live video
- **Multi-source Input** (camera feed or video file)
- **Model Training Interface** for custom datasets
- **Simple GUI** built with Tkinter
